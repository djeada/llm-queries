> A comprehensive collection of practical prompts, local LLM setup guides, and curated references for building, using, and evaluating language-model workflows.

## Why This Repository?

Working with LLMs effectively requires more than just access to a model—it requires well-crafted prompts, understanding of model behavior, and practical knowledge of deployment options. This repository provides:

- **Battle-tested prompts** for common tasks like writing, job searching, and content creation
- **Local deployment guides** for running models on your own hardware
- **Curated learning resources** from leading AI labs and practitioners
- **Slide decks** for teaching and learning core LLM concepts

### Learning Paths

**For Beginners:**
1. Start with [`slides/what_are_llms.md`](slides/what_are_llms.md) to understand fundamentals
2. Learn prompting basics in [`slides/intro_to_prompts.md`](slides/intro_to_prompts.md)
3. Try the text prompts in [`prompts/text/`](prompts/text/)

**For Practitioners:**
1. Review [`resources/gpt_4_1_prompting_guide.md`](resources/gpt_4_1_prompting_guide.md)
2. Set up local models with [`local_setup_guides/local_models_intro.md`](local_setup_guides/local_models_intro.md)
3. Explore agent patterns in [`resources/practical_guide_to_building_agents.md`](resources/practical_guide_to_building_agents.md)

## Use Cases

### Writing & Content

```
prompts/text/improve_article.md  → Expand and polish draft content
prompts/text/format_lists.md     → Convert prose to structured lists
prompts/text/simplify_vocabulary.md → Remove jargon and buzzwords
```

### Career Development

```
prompts/job_search/resume.md     → Tailor resume to job descriptions
prompts/job_search/interview_questions.md → Generate practice Q&A
```

### Local Deployment

```
local_setup_guides/local_models_intro.md → Ollama setup and model selection
local_setup_guides/deepseek_r1.md        → Run DeepSeek reasoning models
```

### Learning & Teaching

```
slides/what_are_llms.md          → Core LLM concepts with math

```

## Example Prompt in Action

**Prompt** (from [`prompts/text/improve_article.md`](prompts/text/improve_article.md)):

```text
Revise the following text by:
1. Expanding each paragraph with concrete examples or explanations.
2. Correcting any factual or grammatical errors.
3. Enhancing clarity with straightforward language.
```

**Input:**

```text
Caching improves web performance.
```

**Output:**

```text
Caching speeds up a website by storing frequently used data so the server 
does not have to rebuild the same response each time. The result is faster 
page loads for users and less work for your backend during traffic spikes.
```

## Best Practices

When using prompts from this repository:

1. **Test with your target model** — Prompts may perform differently across GPT-4, Claude, Llama, etc.
2. **Iterate and refine** — Start with the base prompt, then customize for your specific use case
3. **Check the "Expected output" section** — Most prompt files describe what good output looks like
4. **Combine prompts** — Chain multiple prompts for complex workflows
5. **Document your variations** — Keep notes on what works for your specific needs
