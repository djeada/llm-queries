### 1. Agent Fundamentals  
- **Core Components:** Agent (LLM + tools + instructions), Runner (execution engine), and Tool Interfaces.  
- **Design Principles:** Clear prompt structure, descriptive tool definitions, modularity for maintainability.  
- **Workflow Loop:** Perception → Reasoning → Action → Feedback.  

### 2. Single-Agent Architecture  
- **Use Case:** Linear tasks with self-contained context.  
- **Implementation:** Expose agent functionality via `agent.as_tool()`, ensuring parameter clarity.  
- **Trade-offs:** Simplicity vs. prompt complexity; consider context window limits.  

### 3. Multi-Agent Patterns  
- **Manager Pattern:** Central orchestrator delegates subtasks to specialized agents; ideal for workflows requiring control flow.  
- **Decentralized Pattern:** Peer-to-peer handoffs—agents transfer state when domain expertise shifts; supports dynamic, distributed workflows.  

### 4. Guardrails & Safety  
- **Guardrail Types:** Relevance/safety classifiers, PII filters, moderation API.  
- **Implementation Steps:**  
  1. Start with privacy and content safety.  
  2. Add edge-case protections iteratively.  
  3. Balance security with user experience.  
- **Tool Safeguards:** Risk ratings trigger additional checks or human review.  

### 5. Human-in-the-Loop  
- **Trigger Conditions:** High-risk actions, retry limits reached, ambiguous outputs.  
- **Intervention Modes:** Approval gates, rollback mechanisms, manual corrections.  
- **Use Cases:** Financial transactions, critical system operations, compliance-sensitive tasks.  

### 6. Deployment & Monitoring  
- **Metrics:** Task success rate, tool usage frequency, response latency, error types.  
- **Logging & Alerts:** Structured logs of decisions and tool calls; real-time alerts on failures or policy violations.  
- **Iteration Cycle:** Deploy → Monitor → Analyze → Refine prompts, tools, and guardrails.
