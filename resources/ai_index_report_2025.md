## Benchmark performance & capabilities

New stress tests like MMMU, GPQA, and SWE-bench highlight rapid gains in 2024—roughly +18.8% on MMMU, +48.9% on GPQA, and +67.3% on SWE-bench. Video generation quality improved notably, and agentic language models now beat humans on timed programming tasks.

## Real-world adoption

AI use broadened across sectors. The FDA cleared 223 AI-enabled medical devices in 2023 (up from 6 in 2015). Autonomous mobility scaled, with Waymo surpassing 150,000 weekly rides and Baidu’s Apollo Go operating in several Chinese cities.

## Investment & business impact

U.S. private AI investment reached about \$109.1B in 2024, compared with \$9.3B in China and \$4.5B in the U.K. Generative AI drew \$33.9B globally (+18.7% year over year). Around 78% of organizations reported using AI in 2024, and research links AI to productivity gains and narrower skill gaps.

## Model leadership & global competition

2024 saw a wave of notable model launches—roughly 40 from the U.S., 15 from China, and 3 from Europe. Benchmark gaps on MMLU and HumanEval narrowed to near parity versus 2023. China led on publications and patents, with growing contributions from the Middle East, Latin America, and Southeast Asia.

## Responsible AI ecosystem

Incidents tied to AI rose, while standardized safety evaluations remain limited among major developers. New benchmarks—HELM Safety, AIR-Bench, FACTS—are emerging. Many companies recognize risks but lag on concrete Responsible AI actions. Governments including the OECD, EU, U.N., and African Union advanced transparency and trust frameworks in 2024.

## Public sentiment & optimism

Optimism about AI is highest in China (83%), Indonesia (80%), and Thailand (77%), and lower in Canada (40%), the U.S. (39%), and the Netherlands (36%). Since 2022, optimism increased in Germany and France (+10% each), Canada (+8%), the U.K. (+8%), and the U.S. (+4%).

## Efficiency, accessibility & costs

Inference costs at roughly GPT-3.5 levels fell by more than 280× from Nov 2022 to Oct 2024. Hardware costs dropped around 30% annually, while energy efficiency improved about 40%. Open-weight models closed the performance gap to within \~1.7% of closed systems, lowering barriers to entry.

## Regulatory & government initiatives

U.S. federal AI actions doubled in 2024 to 59, spanning twice as many agencies. Globally, AI mentions in legislation rose 21.3% year over year, with a ninefold increase since 2016 across 75 countries. Major public investments included Canada (\$2.4B), China (\$47.5B semiconductor fund), France (€109B), India (\$1.25B), and Saudi Arabia (\$100B Project Transcendence).

## AI & CS education

K–12 computer science is offered or planned in about two-thirds of countries, up from one-third in 2019, with strong growth in Africa and Latin America. U.S. computing bachelor’s degrees rose 22% over the last decade. In U.S. K–12, 81% of CS teachers support teaching AI, though fewer than half feel prepared.

## Industry frontier & research trends

Industry produced about 90% of 2024’s notable models (up from 60% in 2023), while academia continued to lead on highly cited research. Training compute is doubling roughly every five months, datasets every eight, and power use annually. Model skill gaps tightened: the Elo spread from the top to the 10th model shrank from 11.9% to 5.4%, and the top two are only \~0.7% apart.

## Scientific impact & awards

Major prizes recognized both foundations and applications: deep learning in physics-adjacent breakthroughs, protein folding in chemistry, and the Turing Award for seminal work in reinforcement learning.

## Challenges in complex reasoning

Despite strong results on competition-level math, models struggle with PlanBench-style complex reasoning and logic without reliable correctness—an ongoing limitation for high-stakes deployments.
