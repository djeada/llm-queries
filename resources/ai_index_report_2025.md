### 6. Public Sentiment & Optimism  
- High optimism: China (83%), Indonesia (80%), Thailand (77%).  
- Lower optimism: Canada (40%), U.S. (39%), Netherlands (36%).  
- Since 2022, optimism rose in Germany (+10%), France (+10%), Canada (+8%), U.K. (+8%), U.S. (+4%).  

### 7. Efficiency, Accessibility & Costs  
- GPT‑3.5‑level inference cost dropped >280× (Nov 2022–Oct 2024).  
- Annual hardware cost decline: 30%; energy efficiency gains: 40%.  
- Open‑weight models now within 1.7% performance of closed models (down from 8%).  
- Lower barriers to entry enable broader access to advanced AI.  

### 8. Regulatory & Government Initiatives  
- U.S. federal AI regulations in 2024: 59 (double 2023), across twice as many agencies.  
- Global legislative AI mentions +21.3% (2024 vs. 2023); ninefold increase since 2016 in 75 countries.  
- Major commitments: Canada \$2.4 billion; China \$47.5 billion semiconductor fund; France €109 billion; India \$1.25 billion; Saudi Arabia \$100 billion Project Transcendence.  

### 9. AI & CS Education  
- K–12 CS education offered/planned in two‑thirds of countries (up from one‑third in 2019); leading growth in Africa and Latin America.  
- U.S. computing bachelor's graduates +22% over last decade.  
- U.S. K–12 CS teachers: 81% advocate AI in curriculum, <50% feel prepared to teach it.  

### 10. Industry Frontier & Research Trends  
- Industry-produced notable models: ~90% (2024) vs. 60% (2023); academia leads in highly cited research.  
- Model scale growth: training compute doubles every 5 months; datasets every 8; power usage annually.  
- Narrowing skill gap: Elo score difference top vs. 10th model shrank from 11.9% to 5.4%; top two now only 0.7% apart.  

### 11. Scientific Impact & Awards  
- Nobel Prizes: deep learning foundations (physics); protein folding applications (chemistry).  
- Turing Award: pioneering reinforcement learning contributions.  

### 12. Challenges in Complex Reasoning
