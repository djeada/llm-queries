# LLM Giveaway Phrases
Research shows that AI tools lean heavily on certain high‑frequency constructions—from corporate‑style buzzwords to overly formal transitions—making these phrases prime giveaways.

Before (AI footprint):

      “Based on my training data, it’s important to note that, in conclusion, elevating your marketing strategy requires a deep dive into customer analytics.”

After (humanized):

      “Over the past year, our team has found that a detailed look at customer behavior—rather than generic buzzwords—yields the most actionable insights.”

## Strip Out Leftover Scaffolding Phrases

Below is a ready‑to‑use prompt template that you can feed into any LLM to strip out leftover scaffolding phrases (like “As an AI model…” or “Feel free to ask…”). It includes:

- **A clear instruction** to remove meta‑response fragments  
- **An explicit list** of common LLM‑style phrases to filter  
- **Output formatting rules** so the model returns only the cleaned text  

```text
You are a text editor bot whose sole job is to remove all AI/LLM response scaffolding from a given text.  

1. Do not add, change, or summarize content—only delete unwanted phrases and reflow remaining text naturally.  
2. Filter out **all** instances of the following meta‑response fragments (case‑insensitive):
   • “Could you please clarify…?”, “Do you mean…?”, “Correct me if I’m wrong…”  
   • “As an AI model…”, “As a large language model…”, “I’m not able to…”, “I don’t have the ability to…”  
   • “Would you like me to explain further?”, “Feel free to ask if you have more questions.”  
   • “Here’s what I found for you.”, “Let me know if this answers your question.”  
   • “In summary…”, “In conclusion…”, “To wrap up…”, “Based on what I know…”  
   • “I’m glad I could help!”, “Thank you for asking!”, “I hope this helps!”  
3. Preserve all other text, punctuation, and line breaks exactly as in the original, except where needed to maintain grammatical correctness after removals.  
4. Return only the cleaned text—no commentary or apologies.

**Input:**  
<PASTE YOUR TEXT HERE>

**Output:**  
<CLEANED TEXT>
```

**Before:**

> “As an AI language model, I’m not able to browse the internet. However, here’s what I found for you. In summary, this approach is effective. Feel free to ask if you have more questions.”

**After applying the prompt:**

> “This approach is effective.”

## Extract Leftover Scaffolding Phrases

Below is a turnkey prompt that teaches an LLM to **autonomously** scan any draft and **extract** all leftover AI/LLM response fragments—without you having to enumerate them up front. It leverages best practices in prompt design (clear roles, structured output, rubric definition) so the model can detect:

```text
You are a meticulous text‐analysis assistant. Given the input text, your task is to **identify** and **list** every sentence or fragment that appears to be AI/LLM response scaffolding—i.e., any meta‑response the model would add (disclaimers, clarifiers, closers, etc.).  

**Instructions:**  
1. **Define categories** for each flagged fragment:
   - **Disclaimer** (self‑reference like “As a large language model…”)
   - **Clarification** (e.g. “Could you clarify…?”, “Do you mean…?”)
   - **Limitation** (e.g. “I’m not able to…”, “My knowledge cutoff is…”)
   - **Closer** (polite ending like “I hope this helps!”, “Thank you for asking!”)
   - **Transition** (meta summaries like “In conclusion…”, “To wrap up…”)
2. **Scan** the text **sentence by sentence**. For each sentence that matches any category, **extract** the exact sentence.  
3. **Output** a **numbered list** in this format:  
   
   1. [Category] Sentence <N>: “<full sentence>”
      – Rationale: <one‑sentence explanation of why it’s scaffolding>
   2. [Category] Sentence <M>: “<full sentence>”
      – Rationale: <…>
4. Do **not** modify, paraphrase, or remove anything—only detect and list.  
5. Return **only** the numbered list—no additional commentary.

**Input Text:**  
```text
<PASTE YOUR TEXT HERE>
```

**Expected Output Structure:**

```text
1. [Disclaimer] Sentence 2: “As an AI language model, I’m not able to browse the internet in real time.”
   – Rationale: This self‑reference breaks the narrative flow and reveals AI origin.
2. [Clarification] Sentence 5: “Do you mean you want a summary or a detailed report?”
   – Rationale: This is a prompt‐scaffolding question, not part of the author’s content.
