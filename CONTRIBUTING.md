# Contributing to llm-queries

Thank you for your interest in improving this repository! This guide will help you make effective contributions that align with the project's goals.

## Our Vision

This repository aims to be a practical, well-organized resource for anyone working with LLMs—from beginners exploring prompt engineering to practitioners deploying production systems. We prioritize:

- **Clarity** over comprehensiveness
- **Practical examples** over abstract theory
- **Tested prompts** over untested ideas
- **Good organization** over rapid growth

## Ways to Contribute

- Correct factual errors with citations
- Improve unclear explanations

### 📝 Content Additions

- Add new prompt templates with working examples
- Write or expand course review summaries
- Create local setup guides for new tools or models
- Add entries to the glossary

### 🏗️ Structural Improvements

- Improve navigation and cross-linking
- Standardize file formats and structure
- Enhance README files in each directory

## Getting Started

## Content Standards

### File Naming

- Use **kebab-case** for all file names: `my-new-prompt.md`
- Keep names **descriptive but concise**: `improve-article.md` not `a-prompt-for-improving-articles-and-making-them-better.md`
- Use **ASCII characters only**: no accents, special characters, or spaces

### Markdown Structure

Every content file should follow this structure:

```markdown
# Title

Brief description of what this file contains and who it's for.

## Expected Output (for prompts)

- What the user should expect to receive
- Format specifications
- Any constraints

## Main Content

The actual content, organized with clear headings.

## Examples (when applicable)

Before/after examples or usage demonstrations.
```

### Heading Hierarchy

- `#` — Document title (one per file)
- `##` — Major sections
- `###` — Subsections
- `####` — Rarely needed; consider restructuring if you need this level

### Prompt Files

Each prompt file should include:

1. **Title** — Clear, action-oriented name
2. **Description** — What the prompt does and when to use it
3. **Expected Output** — What format and content to expect
4. **The Prompt** — In a code block with `text` language tag
5. **Example** — Before/after demonstration
6. **Notes** — Model compatibility, limitations, variations

Example structure:

```markdown
# Improve Article

Revise and expand draft content with concrete examples and clearer language.

## Expected Output

- Expanded paragraphs with examples
- Corrected errors
- Clearer, more direct prose

## Prompt

\`\`\`text
Revise the following text by:
1. Expanding each paragraph with concrete examples.
2. Correcting any errors.
3. Enhancing clarity.
\`\`\`

## Example

**Before:**
> Caching improves performance.

**After:**
> Caching speeds up websites by storing frequently used data...

## Notes

- Tested with: GPT-4, Claude 3
- Works best with technical content
```

### Citations and Sources

- Link to sources for factual claims
- Cite benchmark results with links to papers or reports
- When summarizing external content, link to the original

### Writing Style

- **Be direct** — Avoid filler words and unnecessary hedging
- **Be specific** — Concrete examples over abstract descriptions
- **Be practical** — Focus on "how to use" over "how it works" (unless in slides/)
- **Be inclusive** — Write for readers with varying experience levels
